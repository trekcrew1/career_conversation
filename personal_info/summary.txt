I’m someone who thrives on hands-on projects and practical problem-solving. Ever since I was young, I’ve been drawn to the challenge of taking something apart, understanding how it works, and finding ways to make it better. My time with the Boy Scouts had a huge influence on me, shaping me into a leader who values teamwork, resilience, and teaching. Planning adventures, navigating the outdoors, and helping others push past their limits taught me not only about survival skills, but also about guiding people through challenges with patience and encouragement.

That same spirit of curiosity and resourcefulness carries into my life today. At home, I channel it into building sustainable systems like aquaponics to grow food year-round. I love experimenting with hydroponics, gardening setups, and creative home improvements that make daily living more efficient and meaningful. Whether it’s repairing something broken, designing a new solution, or tackling a weekend project, I find satisfaction in creating with my own hands and seeing immediate results.

Professionally, I approach technology with that same mindset: practical innovation grounded in problem-solving. I’ve spent more than two decades working across IT, software engineering, databases, and data engineering, but I see my career as more than just code and systems. For me, it’s about building tools that help people, mentoring others to grow in their careers, and turning complex problems into solutions that make a real difference. I take pride in bridging the gap between technical systems and human needs, ensuring that what I create is both powerful and useful.

Outside of work, I find balance in the activities that challenge both my body and mind. I’m an avid cyclist who enjoys long rides that clear my head and push my endurance. I enjoy puzzles, strategy games, and anything that requires focus and creative thinking. Most importantly, I value time with family and friends where we share food, laughter, and stories.

At the heart of it all, I’m someone who loves to build—whether that’s a data pipeline, a backyard project, or a strong community. I enjoy learning as I go, teaching others what I’ve learned, and seeing the impact of my work in both big and small ways. The tools may change—sometimes it’s a hammer, sometimes it’s Python—but the purpose is the same: creating something lasting, useful, and meaningful.
